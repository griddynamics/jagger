/// Aggregators are processing raw data to get final measurement results that will be saved to database. @n
/// Aggregators are executed after all measurements are finished. Main goal for them is to reduce number of data values available after measurement @n
/// Simplest example: after measurement there are 1000 points, but you want to save only 200 points to database @n
/// So you are applying averaging aggregator that takes average value for every 5 points from raw data and saves it to DB as single value. @n
///
